| ❌   | `_mm_2intersect_epi32`    | Compute intersection of packed 32-bit integer vectors "a" and "b", and store indication of match in the corresponding bit of two mask registers specified by "k1" and "k2". A match in corresponding elements of "a" and "b" is indicated by a set bit in the corresponding bit of the mask registers. |
| ❌   | `_mm256_2intersect_epi32` | Compute intersection of packed 32-bit integer vectors "a" and "b", and store indication of match in the corresponding bit of two mask registers specified by "k1" and "k2". A match in corresponding elements of "a" and "b" is indicated by a set bit in the corresponding bit of the mask registers. |
| ❌   | `_mm512_2intersect_epi32` | Compute intersection of packed 32-bit integer vectors "a" and "b", and store indication of match in the corresponding bit of two mask registers specified by "k1" and "k2". A match in corresponding elements of "a" and "b" is indicated by a set bit in the corresponding bit of the mask registers. |
| ❌   | `_mm_2intersect_epi64`    | Compute intersection of packed 64-bit integer vectors "a" and "b", and store indication of match in the corresponding bit of two mask registers specified by "k1" and "k2". A match in corresponding elements of "a" and "b" is indicated by a set bit in the corresponding bit of the mask registers. |

The destination vector elements are twice as long as the source vector elements.

This instruction delimits the source vectors into pairs of 16-bit BF16 elements.

This instruction reads each signed integer value in the vector of the source SIMD&FP register, saturates the value to an unsigned integer value that is half the original width, places the result into a vector, and writes the vector to the lower or upper half of the destination SIMD&FP register. The destination vector elements are half as long as the source vector elements.

This instruction reads each unsigned integer value from the source SIMD&FP register, right shifts each result by an immediate value, puts the final result into a vector, and writes the vector to the lower or upper half of the destination SIMD&FP register. The destination vector elements are half as long as the source vector elements. The results are truncated. For rounded results, see RSHRN.

This instruction subtracts the vector elements in the lower or upper half of the second source SIMD&FP register from the corresponding vector elements of the first source SIMD&FP register, and accumulates the absolute values of the results into the vector elements of the destination SIMD&FP register. The destination vector elements are twice as long as the source vector elements. All the values in this instruction are unsigned integer values.

All the values in this instruction are unsigned integer values.

This instruction reads each value from the vector elements in the index source SIMD&FP register, uses each result as an index to perform a lookup in a table of bytes that is described by one to four source table SIMD&FP registers, places the lookup result in a vector, and writes the vector to the destination SIMD&FP register. If an index is out of range for the table, the result for that lookup is 0. If more than one source register is used to describe the table, the first source register describes the lowest bytes of the table.

All the values in this instruction are signed integer values.

For rounded results, see UQRSHL.

Bits shifted out of the left of each vector element in the source register are lost.

This instruction reads each value from the vector elements in the index source SIMD&FP register, uses each result as an index to perform a lookup in a table of bytes that is described by one to four source table SIMD&FP registers, places the lookup result in a vector, and writes the vector to the destination SIMD&FP register. If an index is out of range for the table, the existing value in the vector element of the destination register is left unchanged. If more than one source register is used to describe the table, the first source register describes the lowest bytes of the table.
